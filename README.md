# Project: Predicting the Stock Market

### Overview

The S&P500 index aggregates the stock prices of 500 large companies.  Every day investors make (or lose) money by
trading Exchange Traded Funds, which allow you to buy and sell indexes like they were stocks.  Creating a predictive
model to predict the S&P500 could allow traders to make money from their investments.

**Trading stocks is a risky endeavor.  Nothing in this project constitutes stock trading advice!**

**We will be predicting:**

We will be making predictions for the "Close" price of the S&P500 from 2013 to 2015.  We will train a Linear Regression
model using data from before 2013.
